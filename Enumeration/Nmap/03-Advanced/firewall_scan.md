# bypass state-less firewall
state-less firewall check if incoming packet has the SYN flag set up,
trying to not match the SYN packet make it possible to deceive the
firewall and reach behind it.

## NULL scan
NUll scan does not set any flags on TCP header.
if RST/ACK received port are closed.
else port are opened / firewall blocked, because of the lack of response.

```bash
sudo nmap -sN <TARGET>
```

---

## FIN scan
FIN scan set FIN flags
if RST/ACK received port are closed.
else port are opened / firewall blocked, because of the lack of response.

```bash
sudo nmap -sF <TARGET>
```

## XMAS scan
> like a chrismas tree

XMAS scan set FIN, PSH, URG flas simultaneously
if RST/ACK received port are closed.
else port are opened / firewall blocked, because of the lack of response.

```bash
sudo nmap -sX <TARGET>
```

## Maimon scan
> scan for BSD-derived server

Maimon scan set FIN/ACK flags up
BSD-derived system will drop the packet if the port is open exposing the open ports

```bash
sudo nmap -sM <TARGET>
```

---

## TCP ACK scan
> scan for firewall or not

TCP ACK scan will set the ACK flag up and if host has no firewall set up,
the scan will result in all port unfiltered port. but if target have firewall
show filtered and unfiltered port.

```bash
sudo nmap -sA <TARGET>
```

---

## Window scan
> not Windows the OS ...

Window scan will search in TCP Window field of the RST packet returned.
if firewall is not set all port are closed
else show what port a open as closed

```bash
sudo nmap -sW <TARGET>
```

## Custom TCP Flags

```bash
sudo nmap --scanflags <FLAGS> <TARGET>
sudo nmap --scanflags SYN <TARGET>
sudo nmap --scanflags URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN <TARGET>
```
