## Idle/Zombie scan
First attacker communicate with idle (zombie) to retrieve IP ID, then
make request to target with spoofied IP with idle.

if port is closed / filtered, target will respond to idle with RST and idle will not respond,
hence its IP ID is not incremented.

else target init SYN/ACK which idle will respond with RST, which will increment the IP ID

for the final step, attacker will send another SYN/ACK to idle and compare the first IP ID
with the second one

for the reliability of this attack idle target MUST not be busy ...

```bash
sudo nmap -sI <TARGET>
```
