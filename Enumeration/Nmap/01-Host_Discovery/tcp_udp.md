## NMAP
### TCP SYN Ping
send packet with SYN(synchronise) flag set on a given port (default: 80) and wait
for resonse. Open port reply SYN/ACK(acknowledge) and, indirectly indicating
that the host is up. nor a closed port reply RST(reset)

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -PS80 <TARGET>
sudo nmap -sn -PS21-25 <TARGET>
sudo nmap -sn -PS80,443,8080 <TARGET>
```

### TCP ACK Ping
Similar to SYN ping but with ACK(acknowledge) flag set

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -PA80 <TARGET>
sudo nmap -sn -PA21-25 <TARGET>
sudo nmap -sn -PA80,443,8080 <TARGET>
```

### UDP Ping
UDP packet are not expected to lead to any reply, but if we reach a closerd port
we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet (type 3), indicating that the host is up
and available

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -PU80 <TARGET>
sudo nmap -sn -PU21-25 <TARGET>
sudo nmap -sn -PU80,443,8080 <TARGET>
```
