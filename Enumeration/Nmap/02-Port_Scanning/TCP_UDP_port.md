## stats

basically we can considering that a port might be:
- open: service are running here
- closed: no service are running

however in practicall situation we need to consider the impacts of the firewall
therefore, Nmap considers the following six states:

|State|Meaning|
|:---:|:-----:|
|Open | service is listenning on port|
|Closed | no service listenning and reachable, not blocked by firewall|
|Filtered | cannot specify if open or not, usually due to a firewall|
|Unfiltered | cannot specify if open or closed, port accessible.<br>encountered when using -sA|
|Open/Filtered | cannot decide if port is open or filtered |
|Close/Filtered | cannot decide if port is close or filtered |
