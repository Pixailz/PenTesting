## SYN complete
the attacker will send a SYN packet to port on target if port is open,
then finished the process and immediatly send RST packet. else target
will reply with RST/ACK packet.

```bash
nmap -sT <TARGET>
```
- -sT for TCP connect
- -F enable fast mode, scan 100 port instead of 1000 commons.
- -r scan in consecutive order instead of random picking
